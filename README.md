* *The tree graciously bears fruit, yet does not taste its own bounty; the pond reflects the sky above, yet never quenches its own thirst* <br>
* *Even a damp log of wood can be ignited..* <br>
* *In this world, everyone has experienced failure. Therefore, we should not feel ashamed of our failures; rather, we should learn from them.* <br>
