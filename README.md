* *The lamp continues to illuminate its surroundings, even as it burns itself out.* <br>
* *The knowledge we aquire throughout life, the lessons we learn, the experiences we accumulate, are all parts of a precious inheritance that we pass on to the generations to follow.* <br>
* *The tree graciously bears fruit, yet does not taste its own bounty; the pond reflects the sky above, yet never quenches its own thirst.* <br>
* *Even a damp log of wood can be ignited.* <br>
* *In this world, everyone has experienced failure. Therefore, we should not feel ashamed of our failures; rather, we should learn from them.* <br>
* *These woods are lovely, dark, and deep, but I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep.* <br>
* *We shouldn't engage in challenges with the intention of bringing others down.* <br>
